<h1> Django Made Easy </h1>
A tool that installs a django project for you. All you need is what you want to call it.


## How to run
Clone this repository and `cd` to where you want your project to be. Then run `django_made_easy.py` in your terminal. Supply your project name as an argument. It should look like this:
```
$ python django_made_easy.py [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
```

The program will then setup a virtual environment and install django to it. It will also make a django project for you to work in so you can save time and make things simple.

## If you need help...
A tutorial is coming soon :)

## Contributing
Django Made Easy hasn't been tested on MacOS and Linux and it would be great if someone could point out any bugs on other operating systems or general bugs/improvements.
